The Anne Pro 2 was released in 2018, using two [Holtek
HT32F52342](http://www.holtek.com/productdetail/-/vg/HT32F52342-52)
MCUs as the key and led chips. We don't have any support for these
chips yet, please come to [#dev-chat](https://discord.gg/ygssH9x) and
discuss reverse-engineering/debugging with us!

@pantsman0 sent along some excellent [photos of the
