This short book aims to document how the Anne Pro Keyboard really works internally as part of the [alternative firmware project](https://github.com/ah-/anne-key).

What is the Anne Pro and why should I care?
-------------------------------------------

It's a cheap (around $50 shipped on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Original-Techhunter-Anne-pro-Wireless-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-with-RGB-Backlit-Gaming-Keyboard-61-Keys-Teclado/32821909053.html)) but good quality mechanical keyboard.

It's also very hackable, being built on two STM32L151 microcontrollers and with all programming pins neatly exposed. Open source support for STM32 chips is very good, they work particularly well with [embedded Rust](http://blog.japaric.io/quickstart/).
